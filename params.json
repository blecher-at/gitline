It will autodetect the category and assignment of branches and groups commits accordingly.\r\n\r\nInstallation / Setup of development environment\r\n-----\r\n- Install Node.js\r\n- Install Gulp globally: `npm install -g gulp`\r\n- Install dependencies in project's root folder: `npm install`\r\n- Run `gulp watch` in project's root folder in a second terminal window to compile TypeScript on the fly when a file changes\r\n- To run, execute `gulp run` in project's root folder, then visit http://localhost:3000\r\n- To test, execute `gulp test`\r\n\r\nCreating sample data\r\n-----\r\n- Install [git2json](https://github.com/blecher-at/git2json)\r\n- run `git json > myfile.json` - in a cronjob presumably\r\n- point `src/index.html` to the newly created JSON file\r\n\r\nImports / Third party\r\n-----\r\n- Programming language: [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)\r\n- SVG Rendering: [JSGL](http://www.jsgl.org/)  \r\n- Generic JS framework: [jQuery](https://jquery.org/)\r\n- Hash Generation: [Crypto JS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)\r\n\r\nLegal / License\r\n-----\r\nLicensed under the [Affero GPLv3](LICENSE), which basically says: You are free to hack and use,\r\nbut if you want to build a product out of it, or host it as a service, we need to talk.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
